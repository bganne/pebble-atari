# Atari ST Pebble watchface

This project is about bringing the iconic Atari ST look and feel to Pebble smartwatches. It achieves this by creating a Pebble watchface that mimics the Atari ST's graphical environment.

## Watchface

Located in the `watchface/` directory, this is the Pebble smartwatch watchface. The animations for this watchface are generated by capturing the Atari GEM application (see below) running on a Hatari emulator (specifically with TOS 1.06 French version).

The watchface includes several authentic Atari ST animations:
- **App Startup Animation:** Mimics the app startup sequence of the Atari ST.
- **Busy Bee:** The classic Atari ST busy bee cursor appears every minute.
- **Random Bomb Screens:** Every few hours, a random Atari ST bomb screen will appear, simulating the infamous crashes. This can only be cleared by redrawing the watchface (e.g., by navigating to a menu and returning), providing a truly authentic Atari ST experience, crashes and all!

The font used to display the time and date is [Atari ST 8x16 System by divVerent](https://www.dafont.com/atari-st-8x16-system-font.font).

To build the watchface, navigate to the `watchface/` directory and ensure the `rebble` tool is in your PATH. Then run:
```bash
rebble build
```

## Atari GEM application

Located in the `atari/` directory, this is a simple GEM application for the Atari ST. Its purpose is to generate a GEM (Graphics Environment Manager) window that precisely matches the Pebble smartwatch screen dimensions. This allows for perfect pixel-accurate display on the Pebble.

To build it, navigate to the `atari/` directory and ensure the `m68k-atari-mint` cross-compilation toolchain is in your PATH. Then run:
```bash
make
```

The capture was done using Hatari and ffmpeg:
```bash
hatari --fast-boot 1 --tos TOS_1.06_FR.img --crop 1 --avi-vcodec png --png-level 4 --avi-file out.avi --frameskips 0 --sound off --max-width 320 --max-height 200 --avirecord ./CLOCK.PRG
ffmpeg -i out.avi output_%04d.png
```
